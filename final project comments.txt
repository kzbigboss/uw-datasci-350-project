Thanks for a fun class, Nick!

Important note: If you run the script, I strongly advise you download the playbyplay_data.rds file in to the working directory.  If you donâ€™t, the script could take up to 30 minutes to complete as it downloads/transforms the play-by-play data for all NBA games identified.

My write-up is presented as the HTML document.  I used R markdown to prepare it.

This ended up being 85% data acquisition and transformation, but I had a blast doing it.

If time allows, could you offer some feedback on my write up?  I'd like to see if it's "presentation ready" before I share it with some mentors at work.

Thanks again!
