# uw-datasci-350-project

Thanks for dropping by!

This repository is hosting the code I used to complete statistical analyses as part of my data science studies.  The project was to test two questions using statistical models on any topic.

This project initially started as a Reddit Python API exercise to analyze comments/karma activity during the 2015-2016 Western Conference finals.  I realized I wanted a more diverse dataset than just a single series.  I expanded my scope out to include the entire NBA 2015-2016 regular season and decided to test: 

1. Can box score summary results be used to classify game wins or losses?
2. Does fouling in the fourth quarter of a regular season non-overtime game contribute to a game's win or loss?

To perform these tests, I most of my time was spent learning how to scrape/parse data from [Stats.NBA.com](http://stats.nba.com).  Even after creating the initial datasets, wrangling the data with aggregations and pivots plus building out data features took some effort.  The most interesting part of building the statistical models only took a few moments.  Given that I come form a Business Intelligence background, I wasn't too surprised to spend the majority of my time acquiring and preparing data as opposed to analyzing data.

You can review the statistical analyses and a summary of the code written [on this markdown page](datasci350_project.Rmd).  It's written in R Markdown and used `knitr`.

This project represents a lot of firsts for me.  This effort represents my first time:
* Writing in R
* Scraping data from the web
* Posting original content on GitHub

If you're here, either I asked you to check it our or you were searching how to download data from NBA Stats.  Either way, I would love to hear your feedback.
